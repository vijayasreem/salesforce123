Here is an example of Salesforce trigger code that addresses the user story and acceptance criteria mentioned:

trigger CreditCheckTrigger on Loan_Application__c (before insert, before update) {
    
    // Method to perform credit check and pre-qualification
    public static void performCreditCheck(List<Loan_Application__c> loanApplications){
        
        for(Loan_Application__c application : loanApplications){
            
            // Perform credit check process
            Double creditScore = CreditCheckService.getCreditScore(application.Applicant__c);
            Double financialHistory = FinancialHistoryService.getFinancialHistory(application.Applicant__c);
            
            // Determine loan amount and interest rate range based on credit score and financial history
            Double loanAmount = LoanQualificationService.getLoanAmount(creditScore, financialHistory);
            Double interestRateLow = LoanQualificationService.getInterestRateLow(creditScore);
            Double interestRateHigh = LoanQualificationService.getInterestRateHigh(creditScore);
            
            // Set pre-qualification results on loan application
            application.Loan_Amount__c = loanAmount;
            application.Interest_Rate_Low__c = interestRateLow;
            application.Interest_Rate_High__c = interestRateHigh;
            
            // Provide explanation of pre-qualification outcome to applicant
            String preQualificationExplanation = "Based on your credit score of " + creditScore +
                                                  " and financial history, you are pre-qualified for a loan amount of $" +
                                                  loanAmount + " with an interest rate range of " +
                                                  interestRateLow + "% - " + interestRateHigh + "%.";
            application.Pre_Qualification_Explanation__c = preQualificationExplanation;
        }
    }
    
    // Trigger handler to call the credit check and pre-qualification method
    public static void handleCreditCheckTrigger(List<Loan_Application__c> loanApplications){
        performCreditCheck(loanApplications);
    }
}

Note: This is a simplified example and you may need to modify it based on your specific business requirements and object structure. It assumes that there are custom fields on the Loan_Application__c object to store the credit check results, pre-qualification details, and explanation. It also assumes the existence of separate services (CreditCheckService, FinancialHistoryService, and LoanQualificationService) to handle the credit check process and pre-qualification calculations.
